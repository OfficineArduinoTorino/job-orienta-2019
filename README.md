# Job Orienta Cantinetta

This is the repository of the #SmartCellar #hackJobOrienta hackaton organized by [ITS Energia Piemonte](http://www.its-energiapiemonte.it/), [ITS ICT](http://www.its-ictpiemonte.it/) and [TAM](https://www.its-tessileabbigliamentomoda.it/). 
Officine Innesto produced an early prototype for the students to start working on. 

This Repository hosts most of the knoledge, codes and designs we worked on in the creation of the #SmartCellar
